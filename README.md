# MineCraft
The basic 3D rendering engine is built, you can copy it and paste into the section called "高级弹幕" on bilibili.com.
Hopefully, you can see a terrain block and <b>view it from different angles as you move the mouse! 
Move your character using "wasd"!</b>

# TODO
Add higher-level API for rendering blocks and collision detection is needed.

# Warning
Bilibili has updated the flash player so this project cannot run properly now.
